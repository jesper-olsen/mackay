## MacKay

Reimplemntation of some of the demos David MacKay gives in his Information Theory course [1][2].
The original demos are in Tcl/octave/gnuplot/perl/python - some of them survive on his website [3].
The Tcl demos generally still work as do the few perl & python demos (non graphical).
The octave/gnuplot demos, however, do not work with modern versions of octave and gnuplot.
Also - the demos exist in different version tailord for different environments, e.g. labeled
Lewis and Skye, which probably were different servers in the engineering department.
